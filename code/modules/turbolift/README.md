##### Credit to kmc2000
 - ENSURE that the turbolift object ITSELF lines up with the others. This is to prevent the panel jumping about wildly and looking stupid
 - If you want to make a multi door turbolift, place the controls at least 1 tile away from the doors. That way it switches to the more CPU-intensive area-based door acquisition system.
 - Ensure that turbolift doors are at least one tile away from the next lift.
 - Modify pixel_x and y as needed, it starts off snapped to the tile below a wall.
 - Use the turbolift floors and walls.
